# Contributing

If you feel like contributing to this piece of garbage but don't know what to contribute, here's some "ideas":

[ ] The process of parsing the BPM is still slow (about `1500 ms`for `1000 timings` and a whooping `32000 ms` for `5000 timings`).  
[X] ~~Whenever the user parses their timings, it overwrites the current (previous) output. So maybe add an option to "overwrite" or not.~~   
[X] ~~Add the "clear output" and "copy output" button.~~  
[X] ~~Add an option to automatically copy the output once the user has pressed the parseButton.~~
